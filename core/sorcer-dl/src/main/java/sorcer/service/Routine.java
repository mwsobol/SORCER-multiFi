/**
 * An routine is a procedural service specified by a service requestor -
 * {@link Service#execute}, to a service provider {@link Exerter}. It is a
 * form of service-oriented request with a service context
 * {@link sorcer.service.Context} and a collection of service
 * {@link sorcer.service.Signature}s. The service context specifies service data
 * to be processed by the service provider matching routine's signatures. A
 * routine's signature comprises of service operation and a service types
 * implemented by the service provider.<br>
 * Routines are request interseptors in the form of command objects (in the
 * Command programming pattern) that keep a service requestor completely
 * separate from the actions that service providers carry out. Rotines are
 * also completely separate from each other and do not know what other exertions
 * do. However, they can pass parameters via contexts by mapping
 * expected input context values in terms of expected output values calculated
 * by other routines. The operation {@link Routine#exert} of
 * this interface provides for execution of desired actions enclosed in
 * exertions, thus keeping the knowledge of what to do inside of the exertions,
 * instead of having another parts of SO program to make these decisions. When
 * an exertion is invoked then the exertion redirects control to a dynamically
 * bound {@link Exerter} matching the exertion's signature of
 * type <code>PROCESS</code>. <br>
 * The <code>Routine</code> interface also provides for the Composite design
 * pattern and defines a common elementary behavior for all exertions of
 * {@link sorcer.service.Task} type and control flow exertions (for branching
 * and looping). A composite exertion called {@link sorcer.service.Job} contains
 * a collection of elementary, flow control, and other composite exertions with
 * the same elementary behavior performed collectively by all its members. Thus
 * {@link sorcer.service.Task}s and control flow exertions are analogous to
 * programming statements and {@link sorcer.service.Job}s analogous to
 * procedures in conventional procedural programming. <br>
 * Control flow exertions allow for branching and looping operations by
 * {@link Exerter}s executing exertions. A job combined from
 * tasks and other jobs along with relevant control flow exertions is a
 * service-oriented procedure that can federate its execution with multiple
 * service providers bound dynamically in runtime as determined by
 * {@link Signature}s of job component exertions.
